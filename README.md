# This demos a simple React Web App implementation that meets the following requirements
    - Your task is to build a simple React-based web application that consumes an open API and presents data in a meaningful manner. 
    - The app should have a header and footer both of fixed height and have a scrollable body containing the content.
    - Use any free and openly available API on the internet that returns a list of items (e.g., list of movies, stock info). 
      You can limit the number of results if required.
    - Allow users to filter this list. For simplicity, it is sufficient to be able to filter by 1 field (e.g., movie name)
    - Users should be able to view details of an item in the list by clicking on the item.
 
The application should be structured as below:
## Prerequisites
    - Ensure you have Node and NPM installed on your PC to get started then use the following commands available:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Installs the project dependencies.\

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
